  # update is required to update the repositories to see the new packages for

  - sudo apt-get update

  # Now we can install the newer docker-engine which is required for the newer
  # docker-composer we will install next. The messy options are to force it to
  # be non-interactive (normally it asks you a bunch of config questions).
  - sudo apt-get -y -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confnew" install docker-ce

  # Print out the current docker-compose version. Once this reports 1.6+ then we
  # do not need the following steps.
  - docker-compose --version

  # As of the writing of this script Travis has docker-compose v1.4.2, we need
  # to update it to 1.8+. $DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION is provide from the `env`
  # above.
  - sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  - curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > docker-compose
  - chmod +x docker-compose

  # Check that docker-compose is now running the latest version (or at least the
  # one we specified). This is not to be confused with the version we printed
  # before doing the update.
  - docker-compose --version

  # Setup your application stack. You may need to tweak these commands if you
  # doing out-of-the-ordinary docker-compose builds.
  - docker-compose pull
  - docker-compose build
  - docker-compose up -d

  # You will want this for logging. If one of your containers does not build for
  # whatever reason it's best to report that now before your tests start
  # otherwise it can be really tricky to debug why tests are failing sometimes.
