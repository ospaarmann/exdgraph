## How to contribute to ExDgraph

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ExDgraph. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ospaarmann/exdgraph/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ospaarmann/exdgraph/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of ExDgraph will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the #elixir channel in [Dgraph Slack](https://slack.dgraph.io/) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use ExDgraph in the #elixir channel in [Dgraph Slack](https://slack.dgraph.io/).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
